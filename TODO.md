# TODO

- [] rename git `master` branch to `main` in accord with current development conventions
- [] update DockerFile for dotnet 8 see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/building-net-docker-images?view=aspnetcore-8.0>
- [] add command line option to utilize a public key to encrypt the response.
  example use case: private key in Postman to decrypt echo response, allowing to selectively pull response variables into environment without automatically displaying the plain text string.
